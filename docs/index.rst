   changelog

**SONIC** (Spatial Organization through Nonrandom-pattern Inference and
Comparison) is a Python library
for **detecting** and **comparing** spatial patterns in omics data. 
With it you can score how much each gene's expression depends on space, find gene
pairs that share a spatial pattern, and compare patterns across multiple samples 
without alignment, all through a single statistical framework.

The kernel you pass to the test decides what kind of spatial structure
counts. A CAR or Matérn kernel rewards smooth gradients across the
tissue. A graph-Laplacian kernel rewards sharp boundaries between
neighbouring spots. See :doc:`/guides/kernels` for how to pick one.

The library is built for spatial transcriptomics (Visium, Visium HD,
MERFISH, Slide-seq, Xenium, ...) but works with any data that has
spatial or graph structure.


Key features
------------

- **Reliable.** Uses positive-definite kernels, which avoid the
  false negatives that affect Moran's I.
- **Scalable.** Handles millions of spots through sparse solvers
  and FFT / NUFFT acceleration.
- **Flexible.** Accepts arbitrary 2-D coordinates, regular grids,
  and precomputed graphs.
- **Integrated.** Reads :class:`anndata.AnnData` and
  :class:`spatialdata.SpatialData` directly.
- **Comparative.** Ranks genes by cross-sample spatial-pattern
  differences using alignment-free FFT / NUFFT spectra.


Quick example
-------------

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np
   from sonic import NUFFTKernel, spatial_q_test

   # Spatial coordinates and one gene's expression vector
   rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
   coords = rng.uniform(0, 20, size=(500, 2))
   gene = rng.standard_normal(500)

   # Build a Matérn kernel and test the gene for spatial variability
   kernel = NUFFTKernel(coords, method="matern", bandwidth=2.0, nu=1.5)
   Q, pval = spatial_q_test(gene, kernel)
   print(f"Q = {Q:.4f}, p-value = {pval:.4e}")

.. dropdown:: What is the Q-statistic?

   The Q-statistic
   :math:`Q = \mathbf{z}^\top \mathbf{K z}` measures how strongly
   a feature's values line up with the spatial structure encoded
   by the kernel ``K``. A large Q means the feature is spatially
   structured in the way ``K`` looks for; a small Q means the
   feature is spatially independent under ``K``. Different kernels
   look for different things: CAR and Matérn pick up smooth,
   large-scale variation, while a graph Laplacian picks up sharp,
   local variation. See :doc:`/guides/theory` for the derivation
   and :doc:`/guides/kernels` for picking a kernel.
